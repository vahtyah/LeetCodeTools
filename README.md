Given a string `s` of zeros and ones, return the **maximum score** after splitting the string into two **non-empty** substrings (i.e., left substring and right substring).

The **score** after splitting a string is the number of `zeros` in the **left substring** plus the number of `ones` in the **right substring**.

#### Example 1:
```text

```
#### Example 2:
```text

```


#### Example 3:
```text

```


### Constraints

- `2 <= s.length <= 500`
- The string `s` consists of characters `'0'` and `'1'` only.
